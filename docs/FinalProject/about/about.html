<h2>Hi, Im Lucas Wilson</h2>
<h3>I am an engineering student at CU boulder, currently working towards my Bachelors of Science in Creative Technology and Design</h3>
<h4>I am also an avid motorcycle designer/fabricator</h4>

<p>I have been interested in engineering almost all my life, starting with taking apart my moms vaccuum when I was 5 and slowly
   working my way through catapults, roman scorpions, HHO generators, hand forged knives, hand built computers, home servers self
   hosting my own websites, and more recently a few custom motorcycle projects ranging from building the frame by hand to turbocharging
   an existing bike. Nowadays I dont have as much time for projects since I'm a full time student and a part time mechanic, but when I do
   have time I strive to make the most of it and produce the best projects that I can. Currently as of 12/7/2021 I am working on tuning my
   street legal race bike, a 2001 Honda VTR1000f with many many modifications. Although I could have achieved a higher horsepower with a different
   starting bike, I have always loved the sound, look, feel and torque from a large V-Twin like the VTR1000f. I hope to continue both my engineering
   career and my motorcycle career, with lots of overlap, as I expand outside of CU Boulder and explore the world of engineering.</p>
